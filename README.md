# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Apply machine learning to predict credit card risk using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

## Overview of Credit_Risk_Analysis:
Fast Lending a peer to peer lending services company wants to use machine learning to predict credit risk. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, oversampling of the data is done using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampling of the data is done using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. A comparision of the two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, is done to predict credit risk. Our job is to  Assist the lead Data Scientist Jill using the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether these models should be used to predict credit risk.

## Resources:
Data: LoanStats_2019Q1.csv
Software: Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8 , Python 3.7.11 

## Results:
The code for the machine learning algortithms can be found in the notebooks [credit_risk_resampling.ipynb]() and [credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb]().
